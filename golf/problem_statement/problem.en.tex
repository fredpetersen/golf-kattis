\noindent You and your \textit{N} programmer-buddies are playing a game of golf between projects. The game consist of \textit{M} holes, and each of you has been tasked with writing down your own score for each hole.
\\By the end of the game you disagree on who won, and you decide to settle the dispute by writing a program that will determine the winner.

\section*{Input}
First line consisting of two integers \textit{N} ($2 \leq N \leq 100$), the number of players, and \textit{M} ($1 \leq M \leq 500$), the number of holes.
\\\textit{N} lines follow, consisting of \textit{M} signed integers. The \textit{i}th integer ($0 \leq i < M$) on the \textit{j}th line ($1 \leq j \leq N$) is the score of the \textit{j}th player on the \textit{i}th hole ($ -100 < j_{i} < 100$).

\section*{Output}
Output the number of the player, with the lowest score, and therefore won the game. If there is a tie, output the player with the lowest index.
